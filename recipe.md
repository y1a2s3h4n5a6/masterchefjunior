Make sure to get the prep work done in advance. If the veggies are chopped and pasta cooked in advance, this recipe is a breeze to make. Keep in mind to reserve some water while cooking the pasta. It will be used to thin the sauce later. To start, heat butter in a pan.

Add minced garlic and onions and cook for a minute. Garlic adds a lovely flavor to the pasta, so donâ€™t skip it.

Add carrots, mushroom, and bell peppers and saute for a minute. You can add or skip the veggies of your choice.

Now add flour and cook for a minute. All-purpose makes the best creamy sauce but you can try adding half whole wheat flour for a healthier version
Add hot milk slowly and whisk continuously. This process is very important to get a creamy sauce so be careful while adding the milk.
Add salt, pepper, oregano, and chili flakes and cook the sauce on low heat until it starts to thicken. Keep stirring continuously.
Now add fresh cream and cheese and cook until cheese melts.
Add the cooked pasta along with some of the water in which it was cooked.

Simmer for a minute. Garnish with fresh basil and serve hot
